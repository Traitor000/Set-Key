//What can we do ? {Conceptually}

The Set key block is used to set the key and mode, eg C Major.
It allows you to change both the mode and key of how solfege is mapped to the notes.

//Explain all features and things that can be done with set key

The *Set Key* block will change the key and mode of the mapping
between solfege, e.g., `Do`, `Re`, `Mi`, to note names, e.g., `C`,
`D`, `E`, when in C Major. Modes include Major and Minor, Chromatic,
and a number of more exotic modes, such as Bebop, Geez, Maqam, etc.
This block allows users to access "movable Do" within Music Blocks,
where the mapping of solfege to particular pitch changes depending on
the user's specified tonality.



Movable Do in combination with the Scale/Mode blocks will transpose sections of music in a nuanced way.

The Set-key block allows you to change both the mode and key of how solfege is mapped to the notes.

For example, in C major - Do is C, Re is D, Mi is E, etc

In F major - Do is F, Re is G, Mi is A.

The Set key block is used to set the key and mode, eg C Major
